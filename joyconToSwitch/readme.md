This is my own version of a thing I saw on Thingiverse [Joycon grip to screen mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3135683) by `Davidcanflyy`


Their desgin (while nice) is missing a few things

1. You can't replace joycons when the switch is in
2. You can't charge the switch while using it
3. You can't set down the switch while its in the model without it tipping over

My desgin fixes these

# How to print

I printed this in PLA, 15% infill

Organic supports, placing a support box in the charger hold

3. Line up the switch's charger port with the hole on the model

# How I desgined this

I use solidworks as my 3D model software, I just make it on its side and extruded it
